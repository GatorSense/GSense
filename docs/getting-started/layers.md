# Layers

Any image, mask or annotation loaded or created in [Napari ](https://www.napari-hub.org/)is a `layer` . GSense is built on Napari and gives access to the `Layers` and `Layer controls` menu from the dock widget buttons.



The Layer controls menu is especially useful for correcting the generated masks before exporting. It gives access to a variety of tools like brush, eraser, color picker, the ability to control opacity of masks and other features that add to the annotation flexibility.

This is what the Layers list and and layer controls look like for the `Image data.`
