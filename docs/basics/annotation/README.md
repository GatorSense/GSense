# Annotation

#### **Modify Segmentation Masks**

After segmentation, you can refine or modify the masks:

1. Use tools like **brush**, **line**, or **polygon** in Napari's **Layer Controls** to adjust the masks.
2. Save the modified masks:
   * Use the **Save Selected** button to save a specific layer.
   * Use the **Save All** button to save all layers, including the segmentation results and annotations
