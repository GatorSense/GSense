# RGB images

Loading RGB images is straightforward.

1. Images are loaded without the horizontal sliding scroll bar that appears with hyperspectral images.
2. GSense is primarily developed for hyperspectral images but all the features work with RGB images. In order to perform segmentation on the loaded images, pseudo-RGB images must be generated however, even if the loaded images are 3 channel images.&#x20;
