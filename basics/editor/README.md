# Image Segmentation

### Usage

#### Download custom model checkpoint for root segmentation and move to the 'ckpt' folder (Optional)

GSense supports Vit-h, Vit-b SAM backbones and uses the hugging face transformers library. Downloading model checkpoints for default Vit-h and Vit-b weights is not necessary.

To use a model checkpoint obtained from fine-tuning SAM Vit-b model with [peanut and sweetcorn root images](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MAYDHT), download the custom checkpoint from below link and move it to the 'ckpt' folder.

Note: Make sure to choose 'Vit-b' model type from the dropdown field in the Model Settings tab when using the downloaded custom model checkpoint.
